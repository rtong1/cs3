Bonus Question: 
while(largest != smallest){
	if(((largest - smallest) / 5) != 0){
		count+= ((largest - smallest) % 5)
		configures to grow by 2cm^3 by ((largest - smallest) % 5) times
	}else if(((largest - smallest) / 2) != 0){
		count+= ((largest - smallest) % 2)
		configures to grow by 2cm^3 by ((largest - smallest) % 2) times
	}else{
		count+= ((largest - smallest) % 1)
		configures to grow by 2cm^3 by ((largest - smallest) % 1) times
	}
